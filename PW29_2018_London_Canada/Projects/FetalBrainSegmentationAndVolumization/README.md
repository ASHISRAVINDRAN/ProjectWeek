## Key Investigators
- Estee Goldberg (Biomedical Engineering, Western University)
- Denis Kikinov (Software Engineering, Western University) 


# Project Description
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. --> 
This will be a tool to segment the fetal brain from the a fetal MRI. Afterwards the fetal brain will be compiled into a brain volume for later comparisons


## Objective
1. Take any fetal MRI image
1. Autonomously segment the fetal brain
1. Autonomously produce a brain volume for the segmented brain 

## Approach and Plan

1. Describe planned approach to reach objectives.
