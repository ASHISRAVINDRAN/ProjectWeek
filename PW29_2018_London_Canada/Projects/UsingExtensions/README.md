# Using Extensions

## Key Investigators

- Derek Gillies (Robarts Research Institute)

# Project Description

Supervised machine learning methods require an input image with a corresponding mask for training a network. Currently, the Volume Clip extension is used with the Scene Views module to create these masks, but it is a multi-step process. This project will focus on automating these steps to create masks for applicators in 2D ultrasound liver images.

## Objective

1. Create a module that outputs masks for machine learning applications

## Approach and Plan

1. Dedicate time to learning
2. Talking to more knowledgable people
