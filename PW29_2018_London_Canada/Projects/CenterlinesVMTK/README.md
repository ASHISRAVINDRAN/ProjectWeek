# Working with the Slicer VMTK Extension

# Project Description

Our interest is in using and enhancing Slicer's Vascular Modelling Toolkit (VMTK) extension. We plan to look at how to use VMTK capabilities, and whether they can be used more effectively in applications. We may see if there are capabilities of the VMTK package that can be added to the Slicer extension.

## Objective

1. Compile SlicerExtension-VMTK with VTK9 and Qt5. Fix problems compiling VMTK with the most recent VTK.
2. Using VMTK in Slicer effectively. Extract centerlines using start and end points, rather than using extractNetwork.
3. Explore other VMTK features, and whether they can be added as Slicer modules.

## Approach and Plan

1. Ask for help to compile VMTK with VTK9.
2. Try different approaches to using VMTKâ€™s centreline computation features.
4. Look at VMTK tutorials, understand what else is available in the package, and try to use them from Slicer.
