# Project Description

Our interest is in using and enhancing Slicer's Vascular Modelling Toolkit (VMTK) extension. We plan to look at how to use the modules, and see if there are capabilities of the VMTK package that can be added to the Slicer extension.

## Objective

1. Compile SlicerExtension-VMTK with VTK9 and Qt5. Fix problems compiling VMTK with the most recent VTK.
2. Using SlicerExtension-VMTK effectively. Extract centerlines using ComputeCenterlines module, rather than ExtractNetwork.
3. 

## Approach and Plan

1. With experts, examine VTK9 changes that caused VMTK to stop compiling.
2. Understand options to add glyphs to slice views, try them out.
3. Understand use of ComputeCenterlines, and see if new tools would be useful.
4. Create a loadable module from the template, and set it up to compile with Spline Driven Image Slicer.

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Almost done! JCFR was very helpful.
