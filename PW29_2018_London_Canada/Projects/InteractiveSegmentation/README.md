## Key Investigators
- Houssem Gueziri (MNI) 

# Project Description
<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. --> 
Fast Delineation by Random Walker (FastDRaW) is a graph-based interactive segmentation approach implemented in Python. 
This project aims at implementing a plugin in the SegmentEditor to perform FastDRaW in 3D Slicer.

## Objective
1. Learn how to use the SegmentEditor to develop plugins
2. Integrate python-based code to Slicer

## Approach and Plan

1. Develop a toy example segmentation using the SegmentEditor
2. Starts from the __Grow from seeds__  plugin to adapt to FastDRaW
