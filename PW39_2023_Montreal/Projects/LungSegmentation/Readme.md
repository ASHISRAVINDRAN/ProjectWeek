# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
This is a follow-up to previous 3D Slicer lung CT segmentation PW projects. 


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
Our objective is to improve the lung CT segmentation and analysis processes in 3D Slicer.


1. Improve vessel segmentation
1. Implement emphysema and COPD analysis
1. Develop a concept for lung segment segmentation in 3D Slicer
1. Fine-tune the workflow for surgical planning
1. Work on current publication

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->



# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.
