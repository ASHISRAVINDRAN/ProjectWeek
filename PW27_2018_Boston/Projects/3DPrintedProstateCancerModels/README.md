Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a workflow to create pre-operative 3D prostate
cancer models from multi-parametric MRI data. 


 

##
Objective

1. Segment the prostate, dominant lesion, neurovascular bundles, bladder neck,
urethra,and rectal wall.

2. Prepare segmented imaging data for 3D printing.
 

##
Approach and Plan

1. Learn how to use the SlicerProstate module for prostate segmentation.

2. Review methods to segment other pertinent prostate anatomy in Slicer.

3. Create optimal outputs for 3D printing.
