- [Lo√Øc Michoud](https://github.com/loic-michoud) (University of Michigan)

# Project Description

## Objective

1. Develop a system to allow users of the website to use a statistical model (MFSDA)
2. Develop systems to allow users to use deep learning models about bony changes and disease changing in TMJ OA

## Approach and Plan

1. Use of clusterpost that handles the data transfer, the execution and the monitoring of the job
2. We will add the deep learning models in the web using clusterpost

## Progress and Next Steps
- Developing the pre-processing for MFSDA
- Adding the pre-processing as a plugin on the web site
- Adding the new models of deep learning in the web system
- Developing distributed learning to increase the accuracy of the models
