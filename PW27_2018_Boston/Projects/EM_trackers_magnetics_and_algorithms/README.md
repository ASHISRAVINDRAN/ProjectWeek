# EM Trackers Magnetics and Algorithms

## Key Investigators

- Peter Traneus Anderson (Retired)

# Project Description

Discuss the electromagnetics and algorithms of electromagnetic trackers, both at the workshop and as a starting point for later writeups. Math requirement: understand 3D rotation matrices.

## Objective

- Objective A. Find out level of interest.
- Objective B. Decide what to write-up at and after the workshop and where to put it.
- Objective C. Expand list of references.
- Objective D. Electromagnetic trackers have been used for over forty years in simple augmented-reality (AR) systems called Helmet-Mounted Sights. Pete wonders to what extent the ancient simple AR technology (whether EM or optical or other tracker is used) might be relevant to modern AR efforts.

## Approach and Plan

1. Those who are interested can find me at the workshop: look for a bearded old man in a longkilt.
1. Pete plans to attend the VR/AR breakout session to listen and learn.
