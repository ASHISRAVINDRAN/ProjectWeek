# EM Trackers Magnetics and Algorithms

## Key Investigators

- Peter Traneus Anderson (Retired)

# Project Description

Discuss the electromagnetics and algorithms of electromagnetic trackers, both at the workshop and as a starting point for later writeups. Math requirement: understand 3D rotation matrices.

## Objective

- Objective A. Find out level of interest.
- Objective B. Decide what to write-up at and after the workshop and where to put it.
- Objective C. Expand list of references.
- Objective D. Electromagnetic trackers have been used for over forty years in simple augmented-reality (AR) systems called Helmet-Mounted Sights. Pete wonders to what extent the ancient simple AR technology (whether EM or optical or other tracker is used) might be relevant to modern AR efforts.

## Approach and Plan

1. Those who are interested can find me at the workshop: look for a bearded old man in a longkilt.
2. Pete plans to attend the VR/AR breakout session to listen and learn.

## Progress and Next Steps

1. From discussions this year and years ago, an open-source research tracker must use off-the-shelf data-acquisition electronics, and concentrate specialized efforts on coils, cables, software and algorithms.
2. If an application can be tracked optically, that application should be tracked optically. Advances in cameras, computers, and algorithms have made optical trackers low-cost and accurate (no subtle field-distortion effects). Also, optical trackers are obvious in how they work, and in when they don't work (when the cameras can't see the objects being tracked).
3. Pete thanks one of the presenters for showing the presenter's laptop computer running in nighttime mode with blue display turned off. Pete has successfully added this option in hardware (by opening VGA blue video signal) to his desktop computer.
4. Pete thanks those with whom he shared conversations.
