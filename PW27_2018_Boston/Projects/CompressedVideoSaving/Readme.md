# Project Description

## Objective

1. Implement and test the saving and loading of compressed video files using the Sequences module.
2. Should be able to:
    - Store video Sequences in memory using a compressed video format
    - Save video Sequences to files in a compressed video format
    - Load compressed video files into Sequences

## Approach and Plan

1. Test the currently implemented version.
1. Fix bugs and implement features as necessary.
1. Integrate these changes into the master branch of Sequences.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->

- An existing version of this feature has already been implemented [here](https://github.com/leochan2009/Sequences/tree/BitStreamForVideo).
- Need to test the existing method to see if it still works, and determine if any changes need to be made.
