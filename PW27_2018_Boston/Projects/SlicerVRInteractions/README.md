# Project Description

## Objective

1. Agree on initial design of user interaction with Slicer through VR
2. Potentially a working prototype showing the basic features

## Approach and Plan

1. Make it more intuitive how to fly around in the scene
1. Make controllers change transforms (maybe determine transform automatically from the grabbed actor), so that changes are reflected in all render windows
    o Constraints of motion (e.g. only along a line), with support of custom handling of transforms (when there is a more complex trajectory etc.)
