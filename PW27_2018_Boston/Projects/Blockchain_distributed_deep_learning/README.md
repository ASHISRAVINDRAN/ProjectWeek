# Project Description

## Objective

1. Develop a system to allow users of the website to use a statistical model (MFSDA) with their own data
2. Develop systems to allow users to use deep learning models about bony changes and disease changing in TMJ OA
3. Deploy blockchain technology to allow users to collaborate without ceding control to a central management intermediary

## Approach and Plan

1. Use of clusterpost that handles the data transfer, the execution and the monitoring of the job
2. We will add the deep learning models in the web using clusterpost

## Progress and Next Steps
- Adding the new models of deep learning in the web system
- Exploring blockchain technology that decentralize the management, make the data provenance tracable, increase robustness and availability and improve security and privacy.
