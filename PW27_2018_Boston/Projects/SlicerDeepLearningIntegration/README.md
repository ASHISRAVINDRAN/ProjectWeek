# Project Description

Integrate a lung segmentation algorithm based on Deep Learning in Slicer.

## Objective

1. Develop a proof of concept to test the integration of Keras+Tensorflow tools in Slicer
1. Create a Slicer package that can be distributed with these features


## Approach and Plan

1. Integrate the algorithm+pretrained models in CIP (see CIPDeepLearningLungSegmentation).
1. Compile Slicer against a customized Python that includes all the CIP required components
1. Pack Slicer with that Python version
