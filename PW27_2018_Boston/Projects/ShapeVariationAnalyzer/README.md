# Project Description

## Objective

1. Develop a noninvasive technique to provide information about bony changes and disease changing in TMJ OA
2. Classify morphological variations using 3D models of the mandibular condyle
3. Build an accurate neural network for this classification

## Approach and Plan

1. Extract other features to run the neural network and make it more accurate
2. Test with this new model

## Progress and Next Steps

- Data generated for each group with SMOTE algorithm
- Test neural network with this new feature extraction
- Add biological and clinical data to the neural network
