# Project Description
The project seeks to flattened images of the placenta for visualization. Segemented placenta are mapped to a canonical template such as an ellipsoid for visualization of anatomy and function. 
We aim to build a module in Slicer to establish correspondence between the original volume and the flattened one.
## Objective

- Objective A. Map the segmented placenta with minimal distortion.
- Objective B. Map the grayscale intensity from the original volume to the flattened volume.
- Objective C. Build the visualization module in Slicer. Objective is to be able to click on a location in the original volume and automatically move the cursor on the flattened volume.
