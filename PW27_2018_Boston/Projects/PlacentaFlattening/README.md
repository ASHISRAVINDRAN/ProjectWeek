# Project Description
The project seeks to flattened images of the placenta for visualization. Segemented placenta are mapped to a canonical template such as an ellipsoid for visualization of anatomy and function. 
We aim to build a module in Slicer to establish correspondence between the original volume and the flattened one.
## Objective

1. Objective A. Map the segmented placenta with minimal distortion.
1. Objective B. Map the grayscale intensity from the original volume to the flattened volume.
1. Objective C. Build the visualization module in Slicer. Objective is to be able to click on a location in the original volume and automatically move the cursor on the flattened volume.
