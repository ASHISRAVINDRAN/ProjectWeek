# Project Description

Contouring with Segment Editor in VR view!

## Objective

Make basic decisions about usage of Segment Editor in VR and possibly prove the concepts by simple prototypes.

## Approach and Plan

1. Usage of current Segment Editor features in VR
2. Decide which effects will be most useful and how they will be fully supported
3. Come up with new effects that become viable via VR

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Usage of current Segment Editor features in VR
    * The clipped slice(s) will be the slice drawn on, the same way it is done now on the 2D slices
    * By simulating mouse interactions all the effects could be used
2. ...
3. New effects enabled by VR
    * Surface deformation tool: grow ROI on segment surface then push or pull with function (VR possibly makes it actually usable by allowing quick evaluation of the result while changing the input)
