# Project Description

This will be a mini-project to upload and download a scene from Slicer to a Girder instance using the Girder API.

As mgrauer will only be at project week Monday and Tuesday, this will have to start on those days.

## Objective

1. Provide an example of calling the Girder API from Slicer

## Approach and Plan

1. To be determined from the first meeting, when we'll get a better sense of a use case, even if it is contrived.
