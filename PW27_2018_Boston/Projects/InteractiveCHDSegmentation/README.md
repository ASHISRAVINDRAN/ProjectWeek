# Project Description

## Objective

1. Aim: segment all cardiac chambers and great vessels from cardiac MRI, for children with congenital heart disease. 
2. 20 training cases + large anatomical variability - remains a challenge for automatic segmentation.
3. Approach: Integrate some interaction from the user, e.g. scribbles or landmarks.

## Approach and Plan

1. Already have framework for interactive segmentation. Currently testing using scribbles for aorta segmentation.
2. Investigate data augmentation to prevent overfitting - noise / slight intensity changes / small deformations.
3. Parameter tuning.
