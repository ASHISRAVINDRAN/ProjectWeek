# How to create a new project


- Join the weekly [preparation call](../README.md#PreparationCalls) to discuss your idea
- Post questions about the project idea and team on the [Project Week forum](https://github.com/orgs/NA-MIC/teams/pw27/discussions), our communication mechanism as of PW27.
- When you are ready:
-- Add a new entry in the list of Projects by creating a new README.md file in subfolder in projects folder, and copying contents of [project description template](../Projects/Template/README.md) file into it. Step-by-step instructions for this are:
1. Open [project template page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/master/PW27_2018_Boston/Projects/Template/README.md) and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go back to [Projects](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW27_2018_Boston/Projects) folder on GitHub
1. Click on "Create new file" button
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md`
1. Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new README.md
1. Update at least your project's __title, key investigators, project description sections__
1. Add a link to your project to the [main project list](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/edit/master/PW27_2018_Boston/README.md)

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
