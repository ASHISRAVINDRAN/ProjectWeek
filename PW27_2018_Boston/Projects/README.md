# How to create a new project

- Open [project template page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/master/PW27_2018_Boston/Projects/Template/README.md) and copy its full content to the clipboard
- Go back to [Projects](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW27_2018_Boston/Projects) folder on GitHub
- Click on "Create new file" button
- Type `YourProjectName/README.md`
- Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new README.md
- Update at least your project's __title, key investigators, project description sections__
- Add a link to your project to the [main project list](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/edit/master/PW27_2018_Boston/README.md)

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
