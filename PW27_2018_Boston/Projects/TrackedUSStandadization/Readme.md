# Project Description

## Objective

* [Plus Toolkit](http://www.plustoolkit.org) provides access to numerous hardware devices (imaging devices, tracking devices, navigations systems, sensors, etc.) and makes it available through [OpenIGTLink](http://www.openigtlink.org) protocol
* This group has created a common library, [OpenIGTLinkIO](http://igsio.github.io) that simplifies the integration of Plus (and OpenIGTLink-compatible devices or software) into different programs and :
  * Ensure software interoperability between [Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/), [MITK](http://mitk.org/), [CustusX](https://www.custusx.org/), [Ibis Neuronav](http://ibisneuronav.org/) and potentially other imaging platforms.
  * Share software maintenance workload
  * Make it easy to share new features
  * Add specific features for tracked ultrasound and and augmented reality in surgical navigation
