## How to use Discord in Project Week 

For Project Weeks that need to be held virtually, the community uses Discord in addition to Zoom as the main chat communication device. 

## What is Discord?

Discord is a chat app, similar to programs such as Skype, TeamSpeak, or Slack. Primarily built for video gamers, it supports video calls, voice chat, and text. It offers an efficient and semipublic, forum-style community platform and allows the creation of channels devoted to specific topics. For Project Week each channel represents an individual project that can be followed according to your personal interests.  Discord allows for the creation of servers and Project week has its dedicated server.     

Discord can be downloaded for free from https://discord.com/ and is available for all major platforms. 

## Discord Server link

Please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/d5Q6b5ug8u) that will be activated about one week prior to each Project Week.

## Project history

Unless we switch to a different communication program, the Discord chat of each Project Week will be available either on the Discord Server or a separate server, whose adress will be communicated here. This way it will be possible to continue projects in the next Project Weeks and check out the chat history of that project. However, it is the responsibility of each project's first key investigator to update the GitHub project document.
