## How to use discord in Project Week 

For Project Weeks that need to be held virtually, the community uses Discord in addition to Zoom as the main chat communication device. 

## What is Discord ?

Discord is a chat app, similar to programs such as Skype or TeamSpeak, or professional communications platforms like Slack. Primarily built for video gamers, it supports video calls, voice chat, and text. I addition, it offers a semipublic, forum-style community platform and allows the creation of channels devoted to specific topics. For Project Week each channel represents an individual project that can be followed according to your personal interests.  Discord allows for the creation of servers and Project week has its dedicated server.     

Discord is free and available for all platforms. 

## Server link

Please join the \[Discord server\](https://discord.gg/d5Q6b5ug8u) that will be opened about one week prior to each Project Week.
