## Key Investigators
- Leah Groves
- Adam Rankin

# Project Description
Module to integrate hand models into Slicer that are paired with tracking from LeapMotion 

## Objective
1. Stream data from leap motion into Slicer 
1. Pair tracking with models to represent hands
1. Make hands user specfic through scaling models accordingly and allow user input

## Approach and Plan

1. Use PlusServer to stream data into 3D Slicer 
1. Pair cylinder and sphere models with tracking information 
1. Make module adpatable to width and length of digits
