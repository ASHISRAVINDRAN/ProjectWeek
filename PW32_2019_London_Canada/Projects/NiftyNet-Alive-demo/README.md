## Write full project title here
NiftyNet alive unet segmentation demo

## Key Investigators
- YingLi Lu (Robarts Research Institute) 

# Project Description
Some (almost all) of NiftyNet's offical demo at https://github.com/NifTK/NiftyNet/tree/dev/demos can't be run directly by simply `git clone`. Three reasons: 
1. The data used is not publicly available. 
2. The data is not come with the source code.
3. The parameters in the config.ini file is overkill.

## Objective
1. Simulate a small dataset(can be trained quickly on both cpu and gpu)
2. Make a minimum config.ini for unet segmentation
