# Project Description

The goal of this project is to evaluate and extend variants of a volumetric CNN for multi-label segmentation of prostate zones in MR images. 
We already have results, but especially in one zone, results are not stable. The prostate zones are essential for lesion classification and therapy planning. After successful segmentation, a sector map could be extracted that is used for PI-RADS reporting. 
This has the potential to automate and better standardize prostate lesion location reporting.

## Objective

1. Results have to become more stable to be reliable. 

## Approach and Plan

1. Explore network extensions.
1. Extend data augmentation. 
1. Add more regulatrizers and evaluate their effect on the outcome.
1. Initialize a new approach: Generative Adverserial Network?
