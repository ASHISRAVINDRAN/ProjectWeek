# Insula segmentation with 3D Slicer

## Key Investigators

- Filippo Cicali (Mass General Hospital and Harvard Medical School - USA)
- Nikolaos Makris (Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School - USA)


# Project Description

To parcellate accurately the Insula into each principal anatomic units. Specifically the anterior (aINS) and the posterior (pINS) lobules.

## Objective

Using a T1 MRI dataset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) we volumetrically measured the aINS and pINS.
This was achieved by defining the precise anatomy of the insula by identifying the morphology of the insular sulci which are visible using the T1 MRI and the Slicer 3D software.


1. To segment in each coronal slice the aINS and pINS ROIs in order to measure the number of voxels in each ROI per coronal slice.
1. Select a color for the aINS and for pINS to apply in each coronal slice.
1. 3D modelling.


## Approach and Plan

Interact with developers to investigate the existence of appropriate tools and figure out how to implement them.

1. Document the procedure.
1. Disseminate the procedure to beta testers.


## Progress and Next Steps

Implement a method to accurately parcellate the anatomical structure Insula of Reil using 3D Slicer.

1. Improve the procedure with the new 3D Slicer Segment Editor.
