# Project Description
Adding 3D views linking functionalities such as the 2D one.

## Objective
The 3D view controller widget should have GUI for synchronizing the following proprieties: 

* displayed content (what models, volumes, segmentations, etc. are visible in each view)
* view properties (show/hide ruler, orientation marker, background color, etc)
* camera (position, focal point, up vector, orthogonal/perspective, field of view, etc.)

## Approach and Plan

* Design the GUI
* Get feedback regarding the GUI
* Implement MRMLLogic
