# Project Description

We developed a fully automatic, AI based algorithm to segment brachyterapy neeedles from intraoperative MRI images.
Since, we want to make it usable from the 3D Slicer users in a simple and efficient manner, we would like to deploy our algorithm by using DeepInfer plugin.

## Objective

1. Deploy the developed algorithm


## Approach and Plan

1. Learn about DeepInfer plugin and Docker system
1. Deploy the entire workflow

## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->
