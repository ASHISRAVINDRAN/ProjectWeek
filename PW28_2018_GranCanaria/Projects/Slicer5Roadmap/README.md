# Project Description

Draft Slicer 5.0 roadmap

## Objective

1. Update list of Slicer 5.0 changes
1. Collect wishes on this [wiki page](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Tutorials/MigrationGuide/Slicer50)

## Approach and Plan

1. Meet with core developer
1. Collect feedback from the community

## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->

Items to be discussed: (please add anything that you would like us to consider)
- Update to Python3
- Migrate documentation to ReadTheDocs
- Widgets rework (point list, curve, angle, plane)
- Mouse modes (make it easier to define new mouse modes and switch between them; e.g., put window width/level setting in a separate mouse mode, add more built-in mouse modes, ...)
- Built-in 4D data support (Sequences extension)
- Move towards LPS coordinate system (at least change default read/write format for all nodes)
- Internationalization
- Swith to unicode
- Scene views rework: make simpler and more robust
- Lightbox view: can we remove?
- Make Slicer core smaller: are there still components that can be moved out to extensions?
