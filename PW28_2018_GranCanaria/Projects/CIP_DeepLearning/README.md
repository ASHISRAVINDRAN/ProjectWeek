# Project Description

Integration of a deep learning infrastructure that supports future integration of deep learning - based tools.
Two use cases: lung segmentation and pectoralise segmentation

## Objective

1. Integrate all the needed infrastructure components and required external libraries: Keras + tensorflow, etc.
1. Creation of CLIs as a use case


## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->
