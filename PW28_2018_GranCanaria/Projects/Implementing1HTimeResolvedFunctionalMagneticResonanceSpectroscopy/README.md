## Project Description

### Implementing 1H Time resolved Functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy with quantification of broad metabolite spectrum in 3D Slicer .

The aim of this project is to implement signal separation algorithms to process single voxel or chemical shift imaging time sequences.
A sequence is compose of frames with a period of NEX*TR sec each. The output of the processing is an estimated sequence of spectra with 
increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR-improved sequence could be used to extract the chemical kinetic information of metabolites 
might be found in the original sequence in ideal absence of noise, and improve quantification of low-concentration metabolites in each frame. 
Quantification of processed sequence is performed by third-party software.
Algorithms have previous been coded in Matlab, and it is proposed their translation to 3D Slicer numeric and scientific library framework. 
It is also encouraged to implement secure communication routines to interact with quantification software from 3D Slicer application.
