# Segmentation geometry widget

# Project Description

## Objective

* Control over the geometry of the labelmap edited within the segmentation in Segment Editor is important, but so far the only possibility to specify it was by selecting the master volume before adding the first segment. This caused a lot of confusion. If we had a widget to specify labelmap geometry from existing nodes and some advanced settings, then it would facilitate using finer segmentations without the Crop Volumes workaround, editing on oblique planes, and other cases of using special geometries.
