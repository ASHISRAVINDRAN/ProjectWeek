# Project Description

Matlab Bridge provides is a very quick and convenient way to combine the display features of 3DSlicer with Matlab analysis code. A straightforward way of exporting Matlab modules to C++ or python and incorporation of the code in Slicer may allow Matlab programmers to make their modules available to the Slicer community.

## Objective

1. Translate a (few) specific Matlab script to Slicer Python scripted modules
1. Create tutorial about the process

## Approach and Plan

Investigate freeware to convert Matlab code to Python. Document a pipeline for incorporating the code in Slicer for non-developers with a tutorial.
