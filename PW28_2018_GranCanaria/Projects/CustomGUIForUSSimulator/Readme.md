# Project Description

The main goal of this project is to develop a custom graphic user interface (GUI) for an US simulation training system. The GUI should be friendly and attractive for clinicians, trainers and students. The US simulation system was proposed in NA-MIC 27th Project Week and developed in collaboration with the Perklab team.

## Objective

1. Defining the user requirements.
2. Designing the GUI using the slicelet.

## Approach and Plan

1. Analysing the GUI functionalities.
2. Sketching the user interface.
3. Implementing the GUI proposal.

## Progress and Next Steps

We defined several sketchs and chose the better sketch which satisfied the user requirements:
   - US images in 2D viewer
   - 3D scene for the training system (tools and phantom)
   - IGT connection management (buttons and text) 



In first proposal, we implemented the chosen user interface in slicelet module. The slicelet provides a simple way to customize the user interface but our real-time requirement is not fulfilled.    

In second proposal, we developed the user interface in Guidelet module after the Perklab team's suggestion. This guidelet is better suited to real-time applications and, hence, we decided to implement this alternative solution. The user interface is based on the template provided by the Guidelet module.
