## Project Description

### Evaluation of projects: simulator of bone sliding, augmented reality system to be used in surgeries, software for orthognatic
planning that can be friendly used by a maxilofacial surgeons.

The Canary Islands Institute of Technology [ITC](http://www.itccanarias.org/web/) is an applied research Institute belonging to
the Regional Government of Canary Islands (Spain). The ITC is active in different research fields. The Biomedical Engineering Department (BED) represents a spike of excellence in bone loss reconstruction and regeneration. 
During this workshop we plan to work with the GTMA group and explore the possibilities of 3DSlicer and its evironment to plan how we could develop some joint project.
Proposals:
A simulator of bone sliding on their articular surfaces with registration of bone volumes that produce impingement and reduce range of movement.
An augmented reality system to be used in some very difficult custom made surgeries like vertebral body en-block resection with
emphasis in sacrum replacement, acetabular reconstruction or some maxillofacial difficult surgeries.
A software for orthognatic planning that can be friendly used by a maxillofacial surgeons and that can habilitate him to manage
also TMJ centers of rotation during anatomical displacement after simulation of osteotomies.


## Objectives

1. Understand the 3DSlicer environment.
1. Choose the best approach to develop some of the projects studied.
