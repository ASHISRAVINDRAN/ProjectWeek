# Cinematic rendering in Slicer leveraging VTK Physically Based Rendering (PBR)

## Key Investigators

- Shreeraj Jadhav, Kitware, USA
- Jiayi Xu, Kitware, USA
- Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin Kitware, USA

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
- The goal of this project is to identify and evaluate Kitware's previous works on cinematic rendering and how these can be leveraged in Slicer.


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. Review accessible offerings on cinematic rendering (VTK PBR, VTK backends: OSPRay and OptiX, omniverse, etc) that can be utilized inside Slicer.
1. Review existing Slicer modules (such as [Light Module](https://discourse.slicer.org/t/new-module-to-customize-lighting-in-3d-view/8804)) that enhance Slicer's rendering capabilities
1. Evaluate how integrating these in Slicer will affect other modules such as LookingGlass, OpenXR, etc.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.
