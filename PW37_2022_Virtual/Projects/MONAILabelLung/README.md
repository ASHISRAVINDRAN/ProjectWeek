# MONAI Label lung and airway segmentation

## Key Investigators

*   Rudolf Bumm, MD (KSGR)
*   Andres Diaz-Pinto (Nvidia)

# Project Description

MONAI Label is a server-client system that facilitates interactive medical image annotation by using AI. It is an open-source and easy-to-install ecosystem that can run locally on a machine with single or multiple GPUs. Both server and client work on the same/different machine. It shares the same principles with MONAI.

The aim of the project is to set up, train and evaluate a lung and airway server model in MONAI Label

## Objective

*   set up MONAI Label on a PC with moderate to high-end Nvidea GPU
*   load MONAI Label apps and datasets
*   use Lung CT Segmenter for rapid creation of detailed CT Lung labels in MONAI Label for
    *   right lung
    *   left lung
    *   airways
*   do training with the server model 
*   evaluate the AI´s auto-segmentation performance

## Approach and Plan

fine tune the MONAI Label server
