# MONAILabel lung and airway segmentation

## Key Investigators

*   Rudolf Bumm, MD (KSGR)
*   Andres Diaz-Pinto (Nvidia)

# Project Description

Set up, train and evaluate a lung and airway server model in MONAILabel

## Objective

*   set up MONAILabel on a PC with moderate to high-end Nvidea GPU
*   load MONAILabel apps and datasets
*   use Lung CT Segmenter for rapid creation of detailed CT Lung labels in MONAILabel for
    *   right lung
    *   left lung
    *   airways
*   do training with the server model 
*   evaluate the AI´s auto-segmentation performance

## Approach and Plan

fine tune the MONAILabel server
