# Project Description

Set up, train and evaluate a lung mask and airway server model in MONAILabel

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

set up MONAILabel on a moderate to high end gaming PC
load ML apps and datasets 
use  Lung CT Segmenter for rapid creation of detailed CT Lung labels in MONAILabel for
- right lung
- left lung
- airways
train sufficiently 
evaluate the AIÂ´s auto-segmentation performance

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

fine tune the MONAILabel server
provide links to 

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

- Demonstrated the current workflow at the MONAILabel Workshop June 22nd 2022
