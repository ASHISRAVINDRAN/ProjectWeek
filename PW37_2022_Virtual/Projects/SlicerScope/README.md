# SlicerScope extension

## Key Investigators

- Yi Gao (Shenzhen University)
- Steve Pieper (Isomics)
- Andras Lasso (Queen's University)

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
SlicerScope is a microscopy tool for operating on slides like histopathology (H&E) images.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Add the SlicerScope, an open platform for whole slide histopathology image as a Slicer extension.
1. Objective B. Add the nucleus segmentation module into the extension.

## 20220701 What's been done in the week
With the help from Steve and Andras, the extension has been submitted to the extension manager. We will keep watching it's bugs and make improvements.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. It's currently already on github. The extension s4ext file has been updated and the pull-request has been created. We will review the extension with the benevolent dictators.
1. Add the nucleus segmentation (non-deep learning version) to a module under this extension.


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


1. The extension and the module has already been pushed to github
