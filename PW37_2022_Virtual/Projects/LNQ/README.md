## Project Description

Evaluation of Mediastinal Lymph Node Segmentation of Heterogeneous CT Data with Weak Supervision. In particular, 
we have been developing AI models for segmentation of lymph Node and we are trying to adopt our deep learning segmentation models in Monai platform.

## Objective

1. Use MONAI deploy to intergrate the model with clinical platform.

## Approach and Plan

1. Use MONAI framework for preproceccing and inference processing of data.
1. Use MONAI framework for replacing most of our custom code.
1. Create MONAILabel app based on ported code

## Progress and Next Steps

1. MONAILabel team added option to upload local image to the MONAILabel server
1. Team have a strong model for Evaluation of Mediastinal Lymph Node Segmentation of Heterogeneous CT Data with Full and Weak Supervision
