# Project Description
[**Ebatinca S.L.**](https://ebatinca.com/) is currently developing a **low-cost training platform for ultrasound imaging and ultrasound-guided procedures** in low- and middle-income countries. We are developing a 3D Slicer based application to perform training exercises and evaluate participants. The app is called [**TrainUS**](https://github.com/EBATINCA/TrainUS) and it is available with open-source license.

Some basic features have already been developed: participant/recording management, hardware connection, selection of training exercises,...

Currently, we are working on the development of basic exercises to train basic ultrasound skills. The app should be able to evaluate the recording made by users and to provide feedback about their performance. 

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Develop basic module to train in-plane and out-of-plane needle insertions.
2. Compute basic metrics to assess performance: distance from needle tip to US plane, distance to target, insertion time,...
3. Display tables and plots to users during evaluation
4. Integrate functionalities available in [PerkTutor extension](http://perktutor.github.io/) to automatically compute performance metrics and to provide feedback to users about their performance.
5. Compute advance metrics using PerkTutor: tissue damage, number of insertions, total path, rotations,...
6. Test exercise with hardware (US, tracker, phantom,...)
7. Integrate exercise in TrainUS app
