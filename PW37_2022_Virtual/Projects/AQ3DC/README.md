# Project Description
The Automated Quantification of Three-dimensional Components (AQ3DC) is a project
focused on developing of a Slicer extension that will inputs a fiducial list from an entire
sample and automatically perform angular or linear measurements between landmarks
in one or more time points. The AQ3DC will provide to the Clinicians/researchers the
possibility to compute accurately different measurements at the same time for all
patients in a sample. Additionally to the quantitative 3D values, the tool will generate
automatically a clinical meaning for the numbers and signs obtained after the
computation. Importantly, this tool will allow clinicians/researchers to save a
considerable amount of time (once the time consuming step of individually perform
single measurement in a single patient one by one no longer will be required) and to
avoid confounding factors during the traditional Q3DC quantitative outcomes
interpretation.
