# Project Description

[NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov) is a cloud-based repository of publicly available cancer imaging data co-located with the analysis and exploration tools and resources. IDC is a node within the broader NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) infrastructure that provides secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Introduce IDC to the group, demonstrate main capabilities, and latest developments.
2. Support users experiencing issues using IDC or completing tutorials.
3. Collect feedback for the future development.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Organize tutorial/breakout session on how to get started with IDC.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Tutorial/breakout session took place on Thursday. Document with the agenda and all the materials presented (slides, Colab notebooks) are here: [https://bit.ly/3NzJNNM](https://bit.ly/3NzJNNM).
2. Follow-up troubleshooting session same day, through discussions with Simon Drouin, identified and fixed gaps in the documentation and notebooks
3. Through a [conversation on IDC discourse](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/t/storing-definitions-of-data-collections-as-dicom-entities/286) that started from a question on PW discord, learned about a new kind of DICOM object that might be suitable for storing cohorts.

IDC Office Hours are open to everyone on Google Meet at [https://meet.google.com/xyt-vody-tvb](https://meet.google.com/xyt-vody-tvb) every Tuesday 16:30 â€“ 17:30 (New York) and Wednesday 10:30-11:30 (New York). Please drop by to ask any questions related to IDC and troubleshoot
issues!
