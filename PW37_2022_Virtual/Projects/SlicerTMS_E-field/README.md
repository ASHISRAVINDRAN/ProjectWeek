# Project Description

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvase procedure used for treating depression. In the TMS treatment, a magnetic coil, which generates magnetic-induced electric field (E-field), is placed on the subject's head to stimulate nerve cells. 

Our projects aims to predict the distribution of the E-field based on the location of the coil, and faciliate real-time treatment planning for TMS. 


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Predicting the distribution of the E-field based on the location of the coil



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Resample the updated input data.
2. Predict the E-field using a pre-trained deep learning network.
3. Achieve the 1 and 2 in the slicer environment.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
