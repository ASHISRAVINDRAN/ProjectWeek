# Project Description

[napari](https://napari.org/) is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images.

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Introduce the use cases addressed by napari
1. Identify and discuss areas for potential napari/ Slicer collaboration, including
    - Using napari io plugins to read data into slicer, see [napari plugin docs](https://napari.org/docs/dev/plugins/index.html)
    - Using Slicer [SimpleFilters](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/Modules/SimpleFilters) on napari layers, and possibly generating gui elements for them using [magicgui](https://magicgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/napari_parameter_sweep/)

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Present napari
1. Be available for one-on-one discussions with the interested participants during project week.
1. Summarize collected feedback, if any.
