# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Recently the feature [has been added to Slicer by Andras Lasso](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/5327) to be able to drag&drop items from the data tree into the views. For the development of the BabySteps project, the goal of which is to plan and evaluate progressive 3D printed casts to align baby clubfoot, sets of data items for each time points need to be managed. A useful feature for that would be to extend the drag&drop functionality so that it shows each visible item from a folder that is dropped in a view.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Implement support for drag&dropping folders into views and show the visible items in that view

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Consider how the feature would generalize from the BabySteps use case to work for other longitudinal applications where collections of reference and derived data must be managed (also should we consider Sequences in the design somehow?)
