# Project Description

SlicerIGT has been developed since 2012 as an extension for 3D Slicer to support navigated medical interventions. For more information, visit the [SlicerIGT website](http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/).

Breakout room #3 at 2pm today (Dec 14)

## Objective

We will add a step-by-step tutorial on how to use recent modules for collecting tracked ultrasound data for AI training, and how to deploy trained AI models in ultrasound-guided interventions.

1. Talk to everyone who would potentially use or contribute to real time ultrasound processing with AI
1. Add slides to the tutorial website
1. Create video that demonstrates the tutorial for YouTube
