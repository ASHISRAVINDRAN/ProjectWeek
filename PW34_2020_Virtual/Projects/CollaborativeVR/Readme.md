# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Virtual Reality (VR) has a great potential to facilitate communication between clinicians. For example, VR can be used to collaboratively plan a surgical case by manipulating 3D models derived from preoperative scans. Slicer already includes most of the components required to build prototypes for this kind of applications: 
- The Virtual Reality module can display everything from Slicer's 3D in VR
- The VolumeRendering and PRISM Rendering modules enable advanced-programmable volume rendering
- The OpenIGTLinkIF module and OpenIGTLink protocol enables communication of medical and tracking data between different devices running Slicer
The Goal of this discussion is to coordinate future development of the above module to enable more natural collaborative interaction in VR.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Review the current functionality of SlicerVR and PRISM Rendering
1. Discuss planned near future developments in those modules 
1. Lay out a vision for the future of interactive VR in Slicer.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
