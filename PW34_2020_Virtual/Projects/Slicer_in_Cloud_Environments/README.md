# SlicerWeb and Slicer in Cloud environments

## Key Investigators

- Steve Pieper
- Theodore Aptekarev

# Project Description

This project is aimed to provide an updated overview of existing techniques of using 3D Slicer over an internet connection.

## Objective

During this project week we would like to:

1. Categorize existing data regarding using slicer over the internet
2. Test and create/link a set of easy-to-use manuals/tutorials/boilerplates that explain basic setup options and use cases

## Approach and Plan

1. Collect, categorize and analyse forum posts that ask about using Slicer remotely.
2. Review existing techniques (Docker, Cloud VM, Slicer Notebooks, Browser-based web app, Headless usage).
3. Create a set of example manuals/tutorials/boilerplates that show basic setup options for some of the existing techniques.
4. Submit manuals for review and agree about featuring them in some place visible to relevant people.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

Work in progress log is tracked in a [public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dVx2fm4doZP9EQCyUkqJ5sXvO3BINfcZ?usp=sharing)
This section will be updated with the summary during the Project week.

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository. If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->

* [SlicerDockers](https://github.com/pieper/SlicerDockers) can run in cloud machines with a container optimized OS on a VM or a regular OS with docker installed.  You can access the desktop by exposing the port or by tunneling the port through ssh.  [SlicerDocker](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerDocker) should also work in this way.
