# Project Description

MONAI is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based, [open-source](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/master/LICENSE) framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging, part of [PyTorch Ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/).
Its ambitions are:
- developing a community of academic, industrial and clinical researchers collaborating on a common foundation;
- creating state-of-the-art, end-to-end training workflows for healthcare imaging;
- providing researchers with the optimized and standardized way to create and evaluate deep learning models.
