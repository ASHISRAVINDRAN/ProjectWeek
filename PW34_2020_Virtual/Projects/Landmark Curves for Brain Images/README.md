# Project Description

The goal of this project is to facilitate the assignment of cerebral cortical areas borders in MRI images by developing a tool and technique for drawing on the surface representation of the human cerebral cortex. Since delineation of different brain areas are often performed by using the depths of cortical sulci as borders (i.e., anatomical landmarks), a semiautomated means to reliably create these borders on different views of the brain would enable fast, reliable and easy parcellation of brain areas. 

## Objective

The overall objective is to design a tool and technique to draw on a surface representation of the cerebral cortex.

1. Objective A. Design a tool to import brain surfaces in Slicer - DONE.
2. Objective B. Add the capacity to visualize scalar overlays on the surface – DONE.
3. Objective C. Develop an interactive means by which anatomical landmarks such as sulci could be drawn on a surface – DONE.
4. Objective D. Refine the curve settings to be able to optimize the position of the line within/on each anatomical landmark – In progress.
