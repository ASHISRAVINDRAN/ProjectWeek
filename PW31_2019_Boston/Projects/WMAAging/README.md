# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Design and streamline workflow for the analysis of dMRI data from geriatric patients.
1. Identify existing and novel functionality to cluster white matter fiber streamlines.
1. Troubleshot existing problems in the analysis workflow.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Exchage expertise and information to identify optimal strategies for white matter analysis.
1. Implement and adapt workflows to improve the robustness of the existing approaches.
1. Test and validate the functionality and results obtained.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. The team has made substantial progress on integration UKF tractography and WM labeling tools (BWH team) with existing functionality to identify cerebral microbleeds (USC team). 
2. An approach to identify, analyze and quantify changes in FA along major WM fasciculi of the brain was agreed upon and prototyped. 
3. Testing and validation of integrated workflows was performed and the two teams made progress on identifying goals for future collaboration.
