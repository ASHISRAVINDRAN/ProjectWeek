# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
The overarching goal of this project is to use pre- and intra-operative imaging to help neurosurgeons determine whether gross total resection has been achieved.  

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Manually identify 10-15 corresponding features in ultrasound images from 5 patients. Save results.
1. Objective B.  Review these landmarks with available neurosurgical ultrasound experts at project week


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. We will identify corresponding landmarks or features in 3D ultrasound images acquired during different time points in brain tumor resection.
2. We are using 3D Slicer to visualize, explore, and annotate these landmarks in ultrasound images.


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. This section will be completed during project week

# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.
