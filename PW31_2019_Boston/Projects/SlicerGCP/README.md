# Slicer in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with GPU support

## Key Investigators

- Steve Pieper (Isomics)
- Christian Herz (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia)

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Running Slicer on Google Cloud Platform with GPU support WITHOUT using dockerized images

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Replicate Slicer running GCP machine with instructions and write them down for the public

**Important notes:**

* The instructions don't account for security concerns so **don't put any data or passwords on the virtual machine** if you need to keep them secret.
* The Google Cloud Platform costs real money once your free trial is over.  **Be sure to shut down anything you aren't using** or your credit card will eventually be charged.
* Be careful with your login information.  If someone takes over your account they **could run up a huge bill that you will be responsible for paying**.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Replicate installation process on machines
2. Write detailed instructions

## Progress and Next Steps
