# Project Description

We have developed machine learning algorithms to automatically quantify the severity of pulmonary edema from chest x-rays on a continuous scale. The resulting assessment can be used for visualization of heart failure patient recovery trajectories in prior episodes of heart failure to support physicians with a data-driven approach to treating patients. We would like to investigate different ways of visualizing the clinical tracjectories that can inform physicians how different patients responded to different medications/treatment plans.

## Approach

1. Look into Crossfilter: http://square.github.io/crossfilter/
2. Look into Vega-lite: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/
3. Look into i2b2: https://www.i2b2.org/
4. ...

## Progress
1. Collected visualization ideas and option from several investigators
1. Developed a prototyping plan

## Next steps
1. Implement some visualization ideas using a few patient datasets
1. Iterate with clinical colleagues on best implementation options
