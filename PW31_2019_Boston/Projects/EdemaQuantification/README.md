# Project Description

We have developed machine learning algorithms to automatically quantify the severity of pulmonary edema from chest x-rays on a continuous scale. The resulting assessment can be used for visualization of heart failure patient recovery trajectories in prior episodes of heart failure to support physicians with a data-driven approach to treating patients. We would like to investigate different ways of visualizing the clinical tracjectories that can inform physicians how different patients responded to different medications/treatment plans.
