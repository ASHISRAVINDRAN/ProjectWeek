# Quantitative Analysis of Cerebrovascular QUTE-CE MRI data

## Key Investigators

- Liam Timms (Northeastern University)
- Tianyi Zhou (Northeastern University)
- Srinivas Sridhar (Northeastern University)

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Vessel segmentation of cerebrovascular QUTE-CE MRA data
2. Present cerebrovascular angiograms in VR
3. Explore 3D printing of cerebrovascular network

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.
1. ...
1. ...

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Discussed scale space particle approach with Raoul Estepar. Will follow up with further discussions and analysis.
2. Discussed VMTK/Slicer usage with Daniel Haehn. Will follow up with further discussions and analysis.
3. With Steve Pieper, we were able to visualize the QUTE-CE MRI data in VR.
