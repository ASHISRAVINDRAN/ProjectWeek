## Key Investigators

- Janne Beate Bakeng (SINTEF, Trondheim, Norway)
- Kyle Sunderland (Queen's University, Canada)

# Project Description

* [Plus Toolkit](http://www.plustoolkit.org) provides access to numerous hardware devices (imaging devices, tracking devices, navigations systems, sensors, etc.) and makes it available through [OpenIGTLink](http://www.openigtlink.org) protocol
* This group has created a common library, [OpenIGTLinkIO](http://igsio.github.io) that simplifies the integration of Plus (and OpenIGTLink-compatible devices or software) into different programs and :
  * Ensure software interoperability between [Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/), [MITK](http://mitk.org/), [CustusX](https://www.custusx.org/), [Ibis Neuronav](http://ibisneuronav.org/) and potentially other imaging platforms.
  * Share software maintenance workload
  * Make it easy to share new features
  * Add specific features for tracked ultrasound and and augmented reality in surgical navigation

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Publish an online standard for sending ultrasound sector information with OpenIGTLink.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. This project week we should formalize the "standards" for ultrasound sector information from earlier project weeks. Support for this has been built into PLUS, CustusX and Ibis Neuronav, but a specification should be made and published on [Source code](https://github.com/IGSIO/OpenIGTLinkIO) / [IGSIO web page](http://igsio.github.io/).

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.
