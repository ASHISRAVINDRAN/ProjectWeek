# Deep Brain Stimulation Navigation

## Key Investigators

- Simon Oxenford (Charite, Berlin)

# Project Description

During deep brain stimulation surgery, (depending on the center) micro electrodes are used to reassess the planned trajectory of implantation. The idea of the project is to communicate with the micro electrode's controler in order to get their location and signals. Together with the planning information these can then be visualised in patient space, including different image modalities, atlases and electrophysiology features.

In order to achieve higher accuracy of the atlases registration to patient space, we are also working on a module to manually fix for mismatches in the registration output.
