# Project Description

The goal of this project is to enable the development of advanced 3D rendering techniques in Slicer. The goal is to facilitate access to GPU shaders and enable GPU-based filtering in Slicer by improving shader access multipass rendering in VTK and Slicer. The [PRISM Module](https://github.com/ETS-vis-interactive/SlicerPRISMRendering) in Slicer will serve as a test environment for the new capabilities.

## Objective

1. Raise awareness about the extension and the new possibilities of programmable volume rendering
1. Find other parties interested in the development of the volume rendering technology in Slicer.
1. Potentially setup a longer discussion later in the week if others are interested

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
