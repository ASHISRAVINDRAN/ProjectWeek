## Key Investigators

# Project Description

The goal is to allow people to quickly transition from viewing images to doing more complex tasks such as segmentation or registration.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. A quick and easy way to get a functioning Slicer environment
2. Ability to browse data, e.g. in IDC, and load same data in cloud-hosted Slicer
3. Pass login credentials from web to Slicer to allow load/save of confidential data

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Build on existing [SlicerMachines GCP boot images](https://github.com/pieper/SlicerMachines)
1. Prototype using [the IDC sandbox](https://idc-sandbox-000.web.app/) that already supports login
1. Use [GCP JavaScript API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/javascript-guide) to launch and monitor jobs

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
