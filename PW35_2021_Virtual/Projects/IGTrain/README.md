# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
Review of available IGT tutorials to develop training material for French-speaking countries.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Recopilation of the existing training materials
1. Objective B. Revision of the training material: current software versions

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. List of available tutorials and training resources
1. Review of the adequacy of these contents to the current versions.
1. A new pedagogical approach
1. Create training material in french

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
After reviewing and testing existing IGT introductory tutorials, we decided to use a different approach: more oriented to the line already followed in the training materials used for African countries, where the more technical contents appear later, once the basic skills have already been acquired. It is a more "learn by doing" approach, where the user is guided through an example and then all the technical background behind it is explained.

The idea is to help and guide different teams taking their first steps into IGT, as the tutorials are sometimes way too aimed for developers or are quite equipment-dependent. The list of tutorial is planned to be modular, so new ones will be added as the implementation program advances in the different participating teams.

This introduction to IGT is also designed to be accessible to all users, so that specific equipment (such as tracking devices, ultrasound scanners, etc.) is dispensed with from the outset and a first practical case is presented using a webcam and optical markers from the Aruco library. An example for the first steps/chapters for this training program would be:

1. Installation of 3DSlicer and Plus modules.
1. Operation of the modules to be used in the work with IGT.
1. Creation of synthetic scenes in 3DSlicer: drawing of elements, importing of elements.
1. Linear transformations: basics and definition in 3DSlicer.
1. Plus configuration
1. First case study: connect the webcam with 3DSlicer via Plus
1. Second case study: use of Aruco markers
1. Playback of recorded scenes with Plus

### internationalization

Tutorials will be published in four languages:

* French
* English
* Spanish
* Arabic

In this project week the importance of having multi-lingual content has been assessed. Even if clinicians and engineers worldwide speak and use english in their daily work, discussing with your colleages or providing training in your native language is a necessity, and it makes things more easier, specially for those who are starting.

There is also the possibility for portuguese versions, but we don't have the translator commitment yet.

### Aim for this project

The original aim for this project was the francophone regions, but after several contacts during this project week with members of the Slicer comunity based in latin-america we've decided to extend our reach for the hispanic community as well.

In Las Palmas de Gran Canaria we are already used to working with African countries, thanks to the geographical proximity and the projects that have been developed in recent years. Now we want to take advantage of another benefit, which is the common language and culture that we have with Latin America and also serve as a gateway for the emerging community of 3D Slicer in Spanish.

### The website

In the upcoming weeks we will set up a website for these online training materials. The url will be posted in this page once it's online.

The team will be integrated by content creators (the ones that will write the tutorials, describing the steps they are taking while setting up their IGT projects) and translators (that will also work as beta-testers for the tutorials, as we want to make them as easy to understand and follow as possible).

If you are interested in participated, feel free to drop a message to Nayra Pumar at Ebatinca. Contributors are welcome.
