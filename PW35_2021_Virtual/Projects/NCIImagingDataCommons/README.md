# Project Description

National Cancer Institute (NCI) Imaging Data Commons is a new component of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC). The goal of IDC is to enable a broad spectrum of cancer researchers, with and without imaging expertise, to easily access and explore the value of de-identified imaging data and to support integrated analyses with non-imaging data. IDC maintains cancer imaging data collections in Google Cloud Platform, and is developing tools and examples to support cloud-based analysis of imaging data. 

Some examples of what you can do with IDC:
* quickly explore the available public cancer imaging datasets using rich metadata, visualize images and annotations, build cohorts of relevant subsets of the data
* retrieve DICOM files corresponding to the selected cohort to a cloud-based Virtual Machine (VM)

In this project we would like to interact with the project week participants to answer their questions about IDC and understand their needs, collect feedback and suggestions for the functionality users would like to see in IDC, and help users get started with the platform.

Free cloud credits are available to support the use of IDC for cancer imaging research.
