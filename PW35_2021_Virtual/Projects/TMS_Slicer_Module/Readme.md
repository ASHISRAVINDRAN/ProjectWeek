# Project Description

Develop a deep-learning powered software for real-time E-Field prediction and visualization in 3D Slicer

## Objective

Visualization of the TMS E-field on brain surface as well as an E-field along fiber bundles (DTI)

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

Integrate the visualization as a new module within the MRML scene architecture.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
