# Project Description

Develop a deep-learning powered software for real-time E-Field prediction and visualization in 3D Slicer.

## Objective

Real-time visualization of an E-field for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the brain surface as well as visualizing an E-field along fiber bundles (DTI).

## Approach and Plan

Integrate the visualization process as a new module within the MRML scene architecture:

- Evaluate different methods to visualize the e-field on the surface mesh (find fastest method appropriate for real time visualization)
- Add rendering of a TMS coil model to the module in 3D Slicer
- Develop an approach to move/rotate the coil model over the brain surface in Slicer
