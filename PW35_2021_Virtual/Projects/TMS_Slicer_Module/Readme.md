# Project Description

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is an nonivasive procedure used for treating depression with magnetic and electric fields to stimulate nerve cells. A TMS coil is slowly moved over the subject's head suface to target certain areas in the brain. 
Our project aims to develop a deep-learning powered software for real-time E-Field prediction and visualization within 3D Slicer.

## Objective

Real-time visualization of an electric field (E-field) for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the brain surface as well as visualizing the E-field along fiber bundles (DTI) and later the possibility to optimize the coil position or to target certain fibers.

## Approach and Plan

Integrate the visualization process as a new module within the MRML scene architecture:

- Evaluate different methods to visualize the e-field on the surface mesh (find fastest method which is appropriate for a real-time visualization)
- Add rendering of a TMS coil model to the module in 3D Slicer
- Develop an approach to move/rotate the coil model over the brain surface in 3D Slicer

## Progress and Next Steps
