# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

This project will kick-start the development of the *Slicer-Liver* extension that will be developed through the [ALive project](https://alive-research.no). The objective of the SlicerLiverAnalysis extension is to provide researchers with tools to perform liver analytics towards planning of liver interventions (resections, ablations). At this point in the project we need to port early prototypes of our resection planning algorithms into 3D Slicer, which may require enabling new infrastructure in Slicer (particularly for handling pluggable markups from modules other than the Markups module). 

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Develop a tool for planning liver resections integrated in a Slicer extension.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Development of a resection initialization widget using markups and shaders
1. Development of a deformables surface using markups
1. Development of interaction between the initialization markups and the deformable surface
1. Development of distanc measurements visualized in the resections
1. Add a GUI to manage resections

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. A prototype of 3D deformable surfaces was already developed in the last NA-MIC week
1. Pluggable markups to support this development was already developed in the last NA-MIC week.
