# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

This project will kick-start the development of the *Slicer-Liver* extension
that will be developed through the [ALive project](https://alive-research.no).
The objective of the Slicer-Liver extension is to provide researchers
with tools to perform liver analytics towards planning of liver interventions
(resections, ablations). At this point in the project we need to port early
prototypes of our resection planning algorithms into 3D Slicer.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Integrate liver resection planning tools in a 3D Slicer extension.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Development of a resection initialization widget using markups and shaders.
1. Development of a deformables surface using markups.
1. Development of interaction between the initialization markups and the deformable surface.
1. Development of distance measurements visualized in the resections using shaders.
1. Add a GUI to manage resections.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
