# Project Description

The goal of the project is to evaluate and implement deep learning approaches to the segmentation of brain structures on MRIs, particularly those with complex shapes and borders.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Investigate and evaluate the utility of MONAI and/or 3D Slicer AIAA to accomplish our goal.
1. Objective B. Set up hardware and software.
1. Objective C. Generate training datasets based on 50 manually segmented ventricles.
1. Objective D. Produce segmentation from deep learning and evaluate results.
