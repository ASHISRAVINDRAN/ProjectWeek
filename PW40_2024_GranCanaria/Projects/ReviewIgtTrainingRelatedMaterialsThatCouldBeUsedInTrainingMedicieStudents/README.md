# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

IGT is a special area of medical imaging-related sciences, and is hard to incorporate into the undegraduate curriculum.
Yet, it would be great, because the students like it, and could more easily be engaged.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1.  Objective A. Contact people who teach IGT, or IGT-related applications as undegraduate courses. Make contacts, discuss good practices, exchange experiences.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1.  Approach people, have talks, take a look at already existing materials (if available).

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1.  Had talk, approached people and made great proges overall! :)
