# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Slicer currently does not support reading/writing (IO) of 5D images. In the driving use case this means a sequence of vector volumes. This project is about continuing an existing effort to add such support into Sequences storage.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Keep developing the current implementation
1. Objective B. Collecting use cases (what exactly to support in the first round)
1. Objective C. Discussing implementation details

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Describe specific steps of **what you plan to do** to achieve the above described objectives.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
