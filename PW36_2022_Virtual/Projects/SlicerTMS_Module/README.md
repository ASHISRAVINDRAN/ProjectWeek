# Project Description

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a nonivasive procedure used for treating depression with magnetic and electric fields to stimulate nerve cells. 
A TMS coil is slowly moved over the subject's head suface to target certain areas in the brain. 
Our project aims to develop a deep-learning powered software for real-time E-Field prediction and a visualization of TMS within 3D Slicer.

## Objective

Real-time visualization of an electric field (E-field) for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the brain surface, possible development of an AR app (over browser).

Measure rendering time in 3D Slicer:
1. Getting renderer: https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#access-vtk-views-renderers-and-cameras
2. Then applying renderer.GetLastRenderTimeInSeconds()
