# Write full project title here

Update the Chest Imaging Platform to support Slicer 5.0

## Key Investigators

- Rudolf Bumm  (KSGR)

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
The Chest Imaging Platform (CIP) is an extension to 3D Slicer that integrates:

CIP functionality as a Toolkit exposing of the CLIs
Slicer specific modules to provide user-friendly chest CT quantitative solutions
Visualization of scale-space particles and labelmaps
Integrated workflows to end-to-end clinical evaluation

In the current preview versions of 3D Slicer (4.13.0) CIP fails to load the following CIP modules because Slicer's "Editor" module has been removed.    

CIP_CalciumScoring
CIP_RVLVRatio
CIP_LesionModel
CIP_Calibration
CIP_MIPViewer
CIP_BodyComposition
CIP_ParenchymaSubtypeTrainingLabelling
CIP_ParenchymaAnalysis
CIP_PAARatio
CIP_AVRatio
CIP_InteractiveLobeSegmentation

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Replace the usage of the "Editor" module in CIP by something different, preferably the SegmentEditor


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
