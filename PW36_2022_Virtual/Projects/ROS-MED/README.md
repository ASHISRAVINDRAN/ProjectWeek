# Project Description

We have been developing [ROS-IGTL-Bridge](https://rosmed.github.io), which is an interface for Robot Operating System (ROS) to exchange data with 3D Slicer.
See [the project page](https://rosmed.github.io) for detail.

## Objective

There are three goals for this project week:

1. Refine the tutorial page, which was created for International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR) 2021.
2. Document the virtual platform (i.e., Docker) used in the tutorial.
3. Ask for feedback from the 3D Slicer community
