# Project Description

Investigate and implement methods to segment the human spine from CT scans.  See [last Project Week's page for background](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW35_2021_Virtual/Projects/SpineSegmentation/).

## Objective

1. Ideal segmentation will independently segment and label the vertebral bodies.
2. We want the system to integrate with Slicer's segmentation infrastructure.
3. We think a deep learning approach using MONAILabel will be useful for this.

## Approach and Plan

1. Learn as much as possible about MONAILabel
2. Investigate [VerSe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09193) and if possible port it to Slicer/MONAI
3. Figure out if/how we can use spine CTs from IDC for training.

## Progress and Next Steps
