# Project Description

This project aims to document the instructions of deploying [OHIF Viewer](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers) v2 on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) as a [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) hosted application. Such hosted OHIF Viewer can be used to connect the viewer to Google Healthcare DICOM stores. The main motivation for this is to support users analyzing the data available in [NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov) in visualizing results of IDC data analysis.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. As simple as possible instructions of deploying OHIF Viewer
2. Collect user feedback


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Go over the prerequisites (GCP OAuth, Firebase)
2. Clean up the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PbYm6HVgsXaUYrcujBr_bPWS5hrBMSUW?usp=sharing) draft prepared earlier
3. Prepare examples of populating a GCP Healthcare DICOM store with analysis results and visualizing those
4. Update [IDC documentation](https://learn.canceridc.dev/)
5. Collect feedback from anyone interested

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
