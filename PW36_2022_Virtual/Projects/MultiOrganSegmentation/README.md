# Project Description

<!-- Experiment and refine methods to segment multiple organs in CT/MRI scans of fetal mice . -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Use MONAILabel to implement an automated segementation pipeline in 3D Slicer
2. ...
3. ...

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Refine inital model and DeepEdit application
2. Experiment with additional data types
3. ...

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Initial model training for mouse embryo segmentation
2. ...
