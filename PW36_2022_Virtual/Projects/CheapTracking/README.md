# El Cheapo Tracking

## Key Investigators

- Steve Pieper (Isomics)

- YOU

# Project Description

Investigate less expensive but still good tracking for IGT.  Modern AR/VR devices use inside-out tracking with IMUs, cameras, lidar, and other sensors (e.g. in phones and glasses).
These are small enough and becoming (maybe?) good enough to consider for IGT.

## Objective

1. Make a plan for determining accuracy and utility of options
2. Plan any implementation efforts or further experiments
3. Consider issues like form-factor, sterilization, re-usability, etc.


## Approach and Plan

1. Survey developments in the field pushed by AR/VR devices
2. Look at any prototypes, e.g. [Steve's WebXR](https://github.com/pieper/SlicerWeb/blob/master/WebServer/docroot/WebXR-controller/index.html) experiment
3. Determine next steps

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
