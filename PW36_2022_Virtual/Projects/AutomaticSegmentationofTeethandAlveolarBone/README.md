# Automatic Segmentation of Teeth and Alveolar bone using MONAI Label

## Key Investigators

- Daniel Palkovics (Semmelweis University, Budapest Hungary)
- Csaba Pinter (Empresa de Base Technol√≥gica Internacional de Canarias, S.L. (EBATINCA), Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain)

# Project Description

<!-- AThree-dimensional visualization of dento-alveolar structures can enhance the surgical planning process, however currently there are no reliable fully automated segmentation methods available to acquire realistic 3D virtual models of teeth and alveolar bone. A time consuming semi-automatic method has previously been utilized for diagnostic purposes and surgical planning of regenerative-reconstructive surgical procedures in periodontology and oral surgery. -->

## Objective

<!-- The aim of this project is to develop an automatic method utilizing MONAI Label to speed up segmentation process of dento-alveolar structures on cone-beam computed tomography datasets. -->

1. Objective A. To develop a fast and relible segmentation method that is capable of the separate 3D reconstuction of teeth and alveolar bone on CBCT datasets of periodontally involved patients
