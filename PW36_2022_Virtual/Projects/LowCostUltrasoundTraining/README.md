# Project Description

Ebatinca is currently developing a low-cost training platform for ultrasound imaging and ultrasound-guided procedures in low- and middle-income countries. We are developing a 3D Slicer based application to perform training exercises and evaluate participants.

Ebatinca will develop open-source features for the Slicer community. 

During project week, we would like to identify new features that may be useful for ultrasound training (connection, visualization, or others).
