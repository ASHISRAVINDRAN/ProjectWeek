# Project Description

Ability to create a mandible reconstruction only from drawing a mandibleCurve and setting up some input parameters

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Achieve automatic planning
1. Objective B. ...
1. Objective C. ...

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Develop the code, test and debug to make it work
1. ...
1. ...

## Progress and Next Steps

1. One algorithm to decimate optimally the input mandibleCurve was made. The mandible reconstruction is based on that decimated polyline (curve). The visualization is done using the previous algorithms of BoneReconstructionPlanner.
