# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

In this project, we aim to rework the interface of the Echo Volume Render module of the SlicerHeart extension in order to make it more intuitive and better adapted to clinical users' needs. 

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Update and polish the module's interface to improve its usability for clinical users. 

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Have a good understanding of the parameters
1. Get input from users on what could be improved (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia)
1. Compare with commercial platforms to see which 3DE parameters are familiar to clinicians
1. Determine the modifications to be made to improve the interface 
1. Implement these modifications in the UI

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

## Long-term Objectives

1. Implement new features similar to TrueView and Glass from Philips (https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/resources/landing/epiq/cardiology)
1. Implement Color Doppler to visualize blood flow
