# Project Description

CERR is an Octave/MATLAB-based software platform for developing and sharing research results using radiation therapy treatment planning and imaging informatics. CERR has a wide variety of dose, imaging, and structure analysis and comparison tools. We would like to develop the ability to easily move data between the CERR ecosystem and Slicer to take advantage of both platfoms' complementary features.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Easy imaging data IO exchange between CERR and 3D Slicer platforms via module UI
2. Enable CERR features for dosimetry and image analysis, ROE Radiotherapy Outcomes Estimator, semi-quanitative DCE features, DL-based image segmentation models

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Slicer-Jupyter notebooks to code the data import/export process and analysis as proof-of-concept
2. Development of UI to make access fast and easy

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. We have composed demo notebooks for running the first steps https://github.com/cerr/sliCERR
2. The GUI is in development
