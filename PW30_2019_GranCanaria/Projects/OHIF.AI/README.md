# Project Description

The aim of this project is to prepare OHIF Viewer for AI use cases. 
Specifically,
1. To visualise encapsulated pdf in OHIF Viewer
2. To provide editable UI interface for segmentation and measurement objects generated by AI Algorithms. 
3. To create audit for any correction applied to generated results.
4. Provision an option to push corrected results back to pacs

## Objective

1. Build on existing codebase and new functionality to OHIF Viewer https://github.com/OHIF/react-viewerbase
2. Further improve OHIF to visualise new datasets.

## Approach and Plan

1. Integrate OHIF with DicomWeb Wado Server
2. Provision call backs to run algorithms
3. Subscribe to results from DicomWeb Server
4. Publish corrected results, if any back to DicomWeb Server
5. Render generated encapsulated pdf for results
6. Visualise the pdf in OHIF Viewer

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Integrate OHIF with DicomWeb Wado Server (Siemens Healthineers teamplay) - completed
- provisioned light weight wrapper to api to integrate with dicom web server
2. Provision call backs to run algorithms - completed
- Algorithm runs automatically to generate Dicom SR report and Measurements.
3. Subscribe to results from DicomWeb Server - completed
- Webhook implemented to subscribe for results (new series availablity)
4. Publish corrected results, if any back to DicomWeb Server - next steps
- Editing of segmentation results and uploading back to dicom web server
- Logging for corrections applied is needed
- Dicom SR plugin to visualise and Edit SR report results is needed
- 3D volume rendering of Dicom SEG object and editing
5. Render generated encapsulated pdf for results - completed
- New Ohif Pdf plugin is created
- Visualisation of smart report in OHIF is accomplished by OHIF Pdf Plugin

-
6. Visualise the pdf in OHIF Viewer - completed
