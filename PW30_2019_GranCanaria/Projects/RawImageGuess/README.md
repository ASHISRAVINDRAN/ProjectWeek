# Project Description

Sometimes unknown file formats are encountered that contain images. There are free tools to handle these (eg. try to guess the bit depth, X and Y resolution, etc) but it is currently not possible from within Slicer.

## Objective

1. Set basic image read parameters (bytes to skip (header), bitness, etc)
2. Display the loaded image in 3D view

## Approach and Plan

1. Add some more functionality.
2. Add ideas so they can be implemented later.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Describe progress and next steps in a few bullet points as you are making progress.-->
Progress:
- all basic image parameters can be set: header to skip, endianness, X, Y and Z dimensions and image bitdepth
Plans:
. set automaic thresholding, automatically update the image, put in into the 3D viewer

# Illustrations
