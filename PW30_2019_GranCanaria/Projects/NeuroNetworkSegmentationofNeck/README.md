# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
We want to implement an automatic segmentation program to get the upper region of airways in CT images. We have approximately 40 CT images of the neck in DICOM files, that we have to segmented for the training. For medical or biological images is  very useful solution the U-net, that is a special type of neural networks. It has a big advantge, that it doesn't need too much images (~30-50 piece).

## Objective

1. Objective A. Making a training data set (~30-40 images). Find a quickly and precise way to segment the upper airways in 3D Slicer.
1. Objective B. Make a baseline U-net, in python programing langauge whit this dataset.
1. Objective C. Testing the program.

## Approach and Plan
