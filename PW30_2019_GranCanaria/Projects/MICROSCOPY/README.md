## Project Description

This project main aim is the development of a new extension/module for 3DSlicer to work with microscopy images. The segmentation is the first approach to the functions to be implemented. More functions will be studied as well as new training material for medical subjects.


## Objectives

1. To develop a new module for 3DSlicer to work with microscopy images.
1. To study the functionalities to be implemented.

## Approach and Plan

1. To study different methods of segmentation. Threshold segmentation and the watershed algorithm.
1. To test algorithms and methods already developed in Matlab.

## Progress and Next Steps

1. To be completed.
