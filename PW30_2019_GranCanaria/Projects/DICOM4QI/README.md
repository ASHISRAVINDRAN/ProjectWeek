# Project Description

This project aims to provide a central location for coordinating development of
DICOM as applied to quantitative imaging applications and evaluation of
implementation in various tools being developed at the Project week.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Provide support (datasets, discussion of the standard, pointers to existing implementations, validation) to developers implementing DICOM Segmentation image, DICOM Parametric map storage and DICOM SR TID1500 "Imaging measurements" template.
2. Document the status of support of those objects in tools participating in the project week.
3. Discuss use cases.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Add pointers to the relevant existing resources.
2. Hold discussions with the developers.
3. Perform evaluation of the new implementations, assemble sample datasets generated by the implementations. Document the status. Projects implementing relevant functionality: OHIF, XNAT, MeVisLab, pydicom, ...

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
