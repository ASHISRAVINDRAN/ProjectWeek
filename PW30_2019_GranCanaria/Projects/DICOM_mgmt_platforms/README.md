# Project Description

Evaluate existing/emerging platforms for managing DICOM data.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

We need a platform to support management of the DICOM data within a lab. Required features include:
* user authentication
* storage of the variety of DICOM objects (should not be limited to DICOM images)
* integrated viewer for visualization of the images, and ideally annotations
* API for data access (read and write)
* integration of batch processing tools (e.g., automatically calculate radiomics features for an image when segmentation of that is submitted)
* should be possible to install on an "on-premises" server to allow handling of PHI data (i.e., cannot be a cloud-only solution)

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->
Install and test the following solutions:
* XNAT (with James Petts)
* CCC? (with Erik Ziegler)
* Girder? (with JC)
* ...
