# Project Description

This project aims to provide a central location for coordinating development of
DICOM Structured Reporting "Image measurement" template (DICOM TID1500) implementation in various tools.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Provide support (datasets, discussion of the standard, pointers to existing implementations, validation) to developers implementing DICOM TID1500.
2. Document the status of DICOM TID1500 support in tools participating in the project week.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Add pointers to the relevant existing resources.
2. Hold discussions with the developers.
3. Perform evaluation of the new implementations, assemble sample datasets generated by the implementations.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
