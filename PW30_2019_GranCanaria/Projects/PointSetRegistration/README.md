# Project Description

This project focuses on applying a point set registration in 2D multichannel images and integrating it in a new 3D Slicer 
module. In order to use this kind of registration, it is necesary to obtain spatial features from the image and represent them
as a point cloud.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Explore strategies to extract a set of features from a 2D multichannel image and convert it to point cloud
1. Select a registration algorithm for two point clouds and validate it with test cases
1. Adapt the whole flow (features extraction and point cloud registration) to the original image
1. Design and implement the 3D Slicer user interface for the proposed registration module 

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Extract features based on contour information 
1. Select, integrate and validate a point set registration algorithm
1. Apply registration result in the whole data imag

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that 
you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
