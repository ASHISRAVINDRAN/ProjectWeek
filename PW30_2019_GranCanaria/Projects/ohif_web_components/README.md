# Project Description

The aim of this project is to collaborate on web components (using [react](https://reactjs.org)) to implement parts of web applications.
Specifically to make the [OHIFViewer](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers) project less monolithic and moving from meteor to react.  This should make it easier to
create plugins for OHIF, and also to create custom projects like [prostatecancer.ai](http://prostatecancer.ai).

## Objective
1. Build on existing codebase https://github.com/OHIF/react-viewerbase ([live demo](https://react.ohif.org))
1. Improve the vtkjs component https://github.com/OHIF/react-vtkjs-viewport ([live demo](https://react-vtkjs-viewport.netlify.com/))


## Approach and Plan

1. Bring everyone up to speed on the current react components
1. Identify any missing components and decide who wants to work on them
1. Develop (plans for) additional demos, tutorials, and documentation to help build the community

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Describe specific steps you **have actually done**.
