# Project Description

This project is a next step in the one presented during 28th PW NA-MIC and it aims to add new features both the graphic user interface (GUI) and the functionalities of the training system.

## Objectives

1. Supporting the multi-language (Spanish, French, English, Portuguese, and Arabic). 
1. Registering several custom layouts. 
1. Calculating the angle between a plane of the US image and a needle and it will be shown in a 3D scene or a 2D viewer.
1. Visualizing the image orientation marker symbol in an US image.
1. Selection of various clinical procedures for training. 


## Approach and Plan

1. Analysing the GUI functionalities.
2. Sketching the user interface.
3. Implementing the GUI proposal.

## Progress and Next Steps
