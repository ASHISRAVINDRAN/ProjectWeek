# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->
We want to implement an automatic segmentation program to get the upper region of arways in CT or MRi images. For medical or biological imagages
is  very usefull solution the U-net, that is a special type of neuronal networks.

## Objective

1. Objective A. Making a training data set (~30 images). Find a quickly and precise way to segment the upper airways.
1. Objective B. Make a baseline python program using this dataset.
1. Objective C. Testing the program.

## Approach and Plan

1. Describe planned approach to reach objectives.
