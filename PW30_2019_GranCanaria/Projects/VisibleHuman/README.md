# Visible Human in Slicer

## Key Investigators

- Michael Halle (BWH)
- Ron Kikinis (BWH)
- Andras Lasso (Perk Lab)


# Project Description

The Visible Human Project produced a large data set of physical cross sections, MR, and CT of a human cadaver. 
This data has been freely available but not redistributable for more almost two decades. Karl Heinz Hoehne from University of Hamburg 
segmented the data and made beautiful rendering of the data.  He has made his segmentation available for open use, and we hope it 
will allow us to redistribute the original data.

* [VHP description from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Human_Project)

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

Convert the Visible Human Project data into Slicer scenes and evaluate.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

* Make Slicer Scene of the head and abdomen.
* Evaluate the segmentation and plan for new work.
* Investigate training opportunities.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Initial VHP Slicer scenes are complete.
