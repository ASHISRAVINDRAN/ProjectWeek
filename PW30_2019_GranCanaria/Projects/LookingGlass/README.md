# Project Description

Interface Slicer to the Looking Glass glasses-free 3D Display (see [Looking Glass web site](https://lookingglassfactory.com)

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

The Looking Glass 3D display offers a new way to look at complex 3D data.  We hope to have an interface to Slicer to look at 3D models.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

* Look at the Looking Glass 3D display API and web API
* Understand interface options.  Fallback is viewing exported 3D models on the display.



## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Got the 3D display to Las Palmas, and set up demo showing 3D model of Visible Human pelvis.


# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.

# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository. If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
