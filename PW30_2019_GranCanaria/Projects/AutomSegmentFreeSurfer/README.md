## Project Description

This project aims to improve the automatic segmentation results generated from the Freesurfer software, by loading these results in 3D Slicer and validating / editing these results in order to gain a better anatomical accuracy.


## Objectives

1.	To segment the brain using MRI images (images provided by Dr. Nikos Makris)
1.	To refine the generated automatic segmentations
1.	To identify the modules/tools in 3D Slicer used during the project


## Approach and Plan

1.	To import the labelmap and MRI files into Slicer
1.	To refine the existing segmentation following the guidance of an anatomist


## Progress and Next Steps

1. To be completed


## Illustrations
