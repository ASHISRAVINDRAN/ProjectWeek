# Project Description

Artificial intelligence (AI) has promising applications in image-guided therapy (IGT), but significant infrastructure development is needed to implement such systems.

## Objective

Develop tools that make it easy to train AI and use AI models in real-time applications.

## Approach and Plan

Get information from project week attendees about their current AI workflows, shortcomings, and wishlist.

## Progress and Next Steps

- [SlicerAIGT](https://github.com/SlicerIGT/aigt) repository contains collection of scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and Slicer utility modules: to be cleaned up and generalized
- Discussed medical image computing AI frameworks that may be considered to be supported:
  - [NVidia Clara](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ai-assisted-annotation-client): already integrated with Slicer's Segment Editor, NVidia-developed models are available on Nvidia Cloud
  - [modelhub.ai](http://modelhub.ai/): [evaluated during this week](../modelhub-ai/README.md)
  - [niftynet](https://niftynet.readthedocs.io/): [model zoo](https://niftynet.readthedocs.io/en/dev/model_zoo.html) contains pre-trained models
