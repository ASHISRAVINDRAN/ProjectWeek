# Project Description

This project aims to build on prototype [lightweight DICOM server that was developed last year](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW30_2019_GranCanaria/Projects/DICOMweb-CouchDB/)

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

* Develop easy to install and test recipes / scripts
* Compare functionality and performance with other DICOMweb implementations
* Brainstorm about non-standard extensions of utility to the community
  * search by reference (e.g. find all segmentations of this image)
  * extract cohorts by tag (e.g. find all CTs with .5mm pixel spacing)
  * represent workflow state (e.g. give list of all studies that do not have manual segmentations)


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->



# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.


# Background and References

<!-- If you developed any software, include link to the source code repository. If possible, also add links to sample data, and to any relevant publications. -->
