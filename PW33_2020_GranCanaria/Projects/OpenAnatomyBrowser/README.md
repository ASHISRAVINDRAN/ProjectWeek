# Open Anatomy Browser in vtkjs

## Key Investigators
- Michael Halle (BWH)

# Project Description
The Open Anatomy Browser (http://openanatomy.org) is a useful tool for visualizing anatomy atlases and Slicer output. However, the current browser was only intended as a prototype and cannot display many current Slicer scenes. This project will create a new browser prototype based on vtkjs, with ITK image readers.

## Objective


## Approach and Plan
1. Display an Open Anatomy atlas in vtkjs.
1. Create a bare React-based application around the render window.
1. Work out coordinate systems and Slicer export.
1. Plan for glTF support.
1. Build out the rest of the user interface.
1. Extend atlas format to deal with scenes.
1. Lock down an API for parsing Open Anatomy scenes.

## Progress and Next Steps
1. Preliminary reading, parsing, and loading existing atlases into vtkjs.
