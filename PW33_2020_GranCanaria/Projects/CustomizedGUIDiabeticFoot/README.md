# Project Description

This project is a next step in the project [Medical Infrared Imaging with 3DSlicer](https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW28_2018_GranCanaria/Projects/MedicalInfraredImagingWithSlicer/) presented during 28th PW NA-MIC. The previous project generated several modules for using the InfraRed (IR) sensors and advanced image processing techniques in 3D Slicer for medical diagnosis, foot ulcers in diabetic patients.

The aim is to create a friendly customized interface for monitoring the foot ulcers in diabetic patients. 
 <!-- Moreover, the interface invokes the different steps for the diagnosis Thinking more lines-->


## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->
1. Refactoring some modules in the Medical infrared imaging extension.
1. Customized interface based on Slicelet.
1. Integration of the cameras in Plus toolkit or 3d Slicer module.


## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Updating the current modules for python 3
1. Updating the current camera codes in the Plus toolkit.
1. Designing the customized interface.
1. Designing the common interfaces for different modules, algorithms, and so on
1. Evaluate SlicerCAT to implement the customized interface


## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->


# Illustrations

<!-- Add pictures and links to videos that demonstrate what has been accomplished.
