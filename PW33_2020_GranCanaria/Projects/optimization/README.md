## Key Investigators

- Hans Knutsson, Linkoping University, Sweden
- Carl-Fredrik Westin, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

THe goal of this project is to provide a tool for finding optimal weigths for extracting Spherical Harmonics components from spherical distribution. The set of coordinades on the sphere can be given as input or chosen from one of a number of precomputed sets.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Introduce a tool for analysis of signal distributions on a sphere to the diffusion MRI community.
2. Provide tool for visualization of 3D point distributions.

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Discuss / demo the CMB platform
2. Integrate ITK into the CMB plaform
3. Integrate display of oriented image data in VTK
4. Basic thresholding 

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
