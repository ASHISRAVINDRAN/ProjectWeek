# Project Description

The ctkDICOMDatabase is a component used both in 3D Slicer as well as the MITK Workbench to manage local DICOM files and offer a UI for browsing these files as well as getting data from a PACS using DICOM C-FIND, C-MOVE and C-GET. Recently the UI has been improved thanks to Andras Lasso ([1](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/commit/4d3ce7eb280806e91c0ce41124d0efb64b3b5f55), [2](https://github.com/commontk/CTK/commit/7f2f24a051fd58118e9d6ddb464eaf085ec05853)), and on previous project weeks there were first experiments on adding DICOM-Web support.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Integrate the recent UI improvements into the MITK Workbench
1. Objective B. Make the ctkDICOM executables work again as a development testbed and simple C++-based DICOM client.
1. Objective C. Investigate different options for DICOM-Web support: qRestSDK, cpprestsdk, using JavaScript within C++

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Update CTK Version in MITK and fix problems.
2. Explore the status of the ctkDICOM and ctkDICOM2 executables.
1. Continue efforts on C++-based DICOM-Web
