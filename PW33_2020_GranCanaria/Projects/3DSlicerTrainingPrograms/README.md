# Project Description

In this edition of the training project, new professionals will work in order to develop new training material and study how to enhance and improve the use of 3DSlicer as a training tool. We intend to create new training tools as new atlases and study its use in the African countries of Senegal and Mauritania. It will also be included the proposal of a training program for Universities in Morocco
