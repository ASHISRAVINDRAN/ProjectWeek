# Interactive medical simulation toolkit (IMSTK) integration

## Key Investigators

- Samantha Horvath (Kitware)

# Project Description

For this project, we are working on improving the 3D Slicer integration with IMSTK

## Objective

Our goal for project week is to improve the current extensions focusing on making simulation functions available from python

## Approach and Plan

1. Refactor existing code to make all functions available for python wrapping
2. Improve support for mesh insteractions
3. Design demo based on probing a mesh with a tool

## Progress and Next Steps

1.  Python wrapping currently not possible with existing code structure - needs more work
2. Worked on updating the old needle insertion code to newer imstk versions
