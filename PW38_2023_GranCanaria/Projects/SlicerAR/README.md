# Project Description

Augmented Reality has increased its adoption in many areas with exciting benefits. Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Madrid, Spain) has already worked in several medical projects based on AR (see their progress in https://biig-igt.uc3m.es/augmented-reality/). On these studies, they usually export information from Slicer to an alternative software (Unity).

This project presents a novel approach to communicate 3D Slicer and Microsoft HoloLens 2 using OpenIGTLink.
