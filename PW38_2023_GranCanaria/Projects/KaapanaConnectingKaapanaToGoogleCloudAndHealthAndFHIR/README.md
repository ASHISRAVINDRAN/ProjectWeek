Kaapana tutorial for the 38th NA-MIC project week: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A7-8Ru0uTJHFFa17rZtkBpvNhJao_F7x/view?usp=share_link

## Key Investigators

- Jonas Scherer (German Cancer Research Center, Germany)
- Andrey Fedorov (Brigham and Women's Hospital, USA)

# Project Description

Working on a native integration of Kaapana and Google Cloud services.

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Running Kaapana on Google Kubernetes Engine
2. Substituting dcm4che with a Google Healthcare DICOM store

Relate to:
- [Kaapana overall](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/Kaapana_overall)

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

1. Set up GCP project for experiments.
2. Evaluate the effort needed to adapt Kaapana to GKE.
3. Start working on adaptation.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. GCP project set up.
2. Jonas started work on this (remotely!)
3. Unfortunately, other meetings of Jonas prevented Andrey and Jonas to meet to discuss this.
4. But: updates from the project channel from Jonas: "I think I have what I need right now ðŸ™‚ I made some progress yesterday and have a connected cluster running in GCP. Now I need to make a couple adjustments regarding the storage claims within our project (that was expected).  I'll write you as soon as I have a first version to try on GCP" and "I still have to change ~ 80% of our storage handling (we should do this anyway)".
