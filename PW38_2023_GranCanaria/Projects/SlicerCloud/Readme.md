# Project Description

How-to setup and run 3D Slicer on an AWS cloud server

## Objective

We want to set up a 3D Slicer AWS cloud instance that can be seamlessly scaled concerning hardware requirements. 

[All necessary steps are documented here](./HowToSetupAWSEC2Server.md).  

We plan to install a 3dviewer.net server instance as a demo how Slicer results could be shared between working groups.
Up- and downscaling as well as running costs will be shown.
We will test how EC2 instances can be accessed from low-cost hardware such as a Raspberry 4.  


## Approach and Plan
