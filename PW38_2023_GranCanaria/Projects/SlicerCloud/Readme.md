# Project Description

How-to setup and run 3D Slicer on an AWS cloud server

## Objective

We want to set up a 3D Slicer AWS cloud instance that can be seamlessly scaled concerning hardware requirements. 

[All necessary steps are documented](./Projects/SlicerCloud/HowToSetupAWSEC2Server.md).  

On that server, a 3dviewer.net server instance will be installed so thyt Slicer results could be distributed between working groups.
Up- and downscaling as well as running costs will be shown.
