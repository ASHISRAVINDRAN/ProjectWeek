# Training system for US-guided lung interventions

## Key Investigators

- David García Mato (Ebatinca S.L., Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain)
- Javier González Fernández (ITC, Spain)

# Project Description

The aim of the project is to develop a training system that provides a quantitative report regarding the use of a low-cost lung phantom [1] for teaching purposes. 

A phantom with several embedded solid inclusions was fabricated. These inclusions are colour coded thus, a qualitative report can be used to indicate the success
of a core needle biopsy (CNB) procedure. However, a quantitative analysis is required. For this reason, the development of a training system is planned.

## Objective

1. Objective A. Fabrication of dedicated phantom 
2. Objective B. Application development

## Approach and Plan

1. Phantom model
2. Tools connections via Optitrack and Plus Toolkit 
4. Application development

## Progress and Next Steps

1. Fabrication of dedicated phantom and CT scan to create model 
2. Tracking fixtures for equipment (Telemed, needle)
3. Optitrack + Telemed setup -> Connection to SLICER
