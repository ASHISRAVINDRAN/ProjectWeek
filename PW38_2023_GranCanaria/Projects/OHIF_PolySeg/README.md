# Project Description

The aim of the project is to continue on the effort of adding polySeg representations for segmentation in OHIF Viewer. This will be a continuation of the work done in the previous [project week](../../../PW31_2019_Boston/Projects/PolySeg4Web/README.md)

## Objective

1. Try to implement the polySeg representation in OHIF Viewer
2. Use the WASM version of the polySeg library

## Approach and Plan

1. Start from a simple example with contour representation
2. Add the polySeg library to the project
3. Implement the polySeg representation in OHIF Viewer

## Progress and Next Steps
