# Project Description
SlicerAstro is an extension of 3D Slicer that aims to provide astronomers with a powerful and interactive visualization environment. In this environment, astronomers can analyze complex sources that automated pipelines find. These sources include interacting galaxies, tidal tails, HI filaments, and stripped galaxies.

## Objective

Update SlicerAstro to Slicer 5

## Approach and Plan

1) Fix compilation with Slicer 5

2) Test under Slicer 5

3) Find issues (some already listed in [issues](https://github.com/Punzo/SlicerAstroApp/issues/4))


## Progress and Next Steps
