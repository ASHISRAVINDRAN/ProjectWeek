=26th Slicer Project Week and 1st Slicer IGT Project Week=

It is a pleasure to announce that the Western Slicer Project Week will be held in London, Ontario, Canada on July 17-21, 2017. This is the first extension Slicer project week that grew organically from a proposed visit of Dr. Nobuhiko Hata to Western. Enough interest existed to propose a small Slicer hackfest, which quickly grew into a full blown project week. With the expansion of the hackfest into a full project week, an additional meeting was arranged in conjunction with SPWW to discuss and develop image-guided therapy specific goals. Thus, this is also the inaugural Slicer IGT Project Week.

This project week is an event endorsed by the [http://www.miccai.org/organization MICCAI Society].
